# Music Player

## Overview

## Features
- **Navbar:** Includes a navigation bar with a toggle button for the sidebar.
- **Sidebar:** Displays multiple playlists with clickable songs.
- **Music Player Section:** Contains an audio player with play, pause, and fullscreen control buttons.
- **Background Animation:** Enhances the visual appeal of the music player.
- **Dynamic Song Selection:** Allows users to click on songs in the sidebar to play them instantly in the player.

## How It Works
- **Navigation:** Clicking the toggle button opens and closes the sidebar menu.
- **Playlist Selection:** Each playlist button expands to show a list of songs. Clicking on a song changes the current song in the audio player.
- **Audio Controls:** Play, pause, and fullscreen buttons control the audio playback.
